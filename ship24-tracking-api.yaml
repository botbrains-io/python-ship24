        The Ship24 API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can [view and manage them in your Dashboard](https://dashboard.ship24.com/integrations/api-keys). A `Default` API key is created after you subscribe to a plan.

        To authenticate your requests, include an `Authorization` HTTP header to all your requests with the following value: `Bearer your_api_key`. (Replace `your_api_key` by the one from your dashboard and don't forget the `Bearer` prefix.)

      title: Tracking
      description: |-
        A `Tracking` object is used in our API to provide tracking results on your `Trackers` . tracking results are basically updated information about a shipments, including shipment-level information, events and statistics. The `Tracking` object is used both in the response body of our endpoints, as well as in the request body of your webhooks.

        A `tracking` object can be composed of the following parts:
        | Field | Description |
        | -- |   -- |
          `tracker` |  In case the `tracking` is pushed by webhook and fetched from a _tracker_, the object `tracker` will be present and will refer to which _tracker_ this `tracking` results comes from. |
        |  `shipment` |  The object `shipment` contains the general shipment information. |
        |  `events`  |  The object `events` contains the tracking event(s), order by date descending (the most recent one is the first one of the array). When getting `tracking` by fetching results from our API, `events` will contains all events of the shipments. When getting `tracking` by webhooks, `events` will contains only the events discovered since the last push. |
        | `statistics`  |  The object `statistics` contains statistics about the shipment lifecycle, such as timestamps of the key milestones of the shipment. |
        | `metadata` *(in webhooks only)* | The object `metadata` contains webhooks related metadata, such as the `generatedAt` date, allowing you to know when the data contained in the webhook has been generated. |

        ### `tracking` object in webhooks
        In the webhooks, `tracking` objects are used in a `trackings` array, directly at the root of the JSON document:
        ```json
        {
          "trackings": [
            {
              "metadata": {
                "generatedAt": "2023-01-19T09:12:39.052Z"
                "messageId": "356a7f93-3ce5-4b49-b560-156537283df9"
              },
              "tracker": {
                "trackerId": "26148317-7502-d3ac-44a9-546d240ac0dd",
                "trackingNumber": "S24DEMO456393",
                "shipmentReference": "c6e4fef4-a816-b68f-4024-3b7e4c5a9f81",
                "clientTrackerId": "3fa99515-3ca0-4901-85bb-056ee016799b",
                "isSubscribed": true,
                "isTracked": true,
                "createdAt": "2021-03-10T05:13:00.000Z"
              },
              "shipment": {
              ...
        ```

        ### `tracking` object in API response
        In the API response,  `tracking` objects are used in a `trackings` array inside the `data` object in the JSON document:
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "trackings": [
              {
                "tracker": {
                  "trackerId": "26148317-7502-d3ac-44a9-546d240ac0dd",
                  "trackingNumber": "S24DEMO456393",
                  "shipmentReference": "c6e4fef4-a816-b68f-4024-3b7e4c5a9f81",
                  "clientTrackerId": "3fa99515-3ca0-4901-85bb-056ee016799b",
                  "isSubscribed": true,
                  "isTracked": true,
                  "createdAt": "2021-03-10T05:13:00.000Z"
              },
              "shipment": {

        ```

    description: |-
      The **Tracking API (Per-call Plans)** is a specific product and associated endpoint on which usage is measured per API Call made. Each API call is synchronously fetching data from couriers which make it slower and more depend on courier's system availability.

      Our standard "Per-shipment" product & plans remain the best choice as it offers more features, allow faster tracking information fetching with less dependency on courier's system availability at a lower cost overall.

        Ship24 will be probing this endpoint using a HEAD request to make sure your server is ready to receive webhooks. A HEAD request and response don't contain any body, you just need to return a 200 OK HTTP code to our HEAD requests. [Learn how to set up and use webhooks](https://docs.ship24.com/webhooks/overview).

      summary: Bulk create trackers
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows you to create up to 100 new `Trackers` in a single operation, based on the specified information. Once the `Trackers` are created, you will be able to receive webhook notifications and/or fetch their tracking results.

        > While tracker creation is idempotent, this endpoint itself is not. Any duplicate within the request or any tracker parameters matching an existing tracker will not create a duplicate `Tracker`. However, providing different information in any of the fields will create a new `Tracker`, as it will be considered as a new shipment.

        The response will include a summary of:
        - The number of trackers successfully created.
        - The number of trackers ignored because they already exist.
        - The number of trackers that could not be created due to errors.

        Additionally, the response will provide details about the created trackers and any errors that occurred during the tracker creation process.

      summary: Create a tracker and get tracking results
      description: "This endpoint creates a new `Tracker` on the specified tracking number , if it does not exist, and returns the tracking results directly. We advise using this endpoint if you are not interested in receiving webhook notifications and just want to fetch tracking results. This way, you can always call this unified endpoint to get tracking results, without worrying about `Tracker` creation and management.\n\n\n> \U0001F6D1 During the very first call for a tracking number, this endpoint will create a `Tracker` and try to return tracking results synchronously if the courier allows it, which can delay the initial answer, at the benefit of getting the tracking results from the first call. **Initial response time may range from a few seconds, up to 1 minute, and results will depend on the courier's system availability at that time.** Subsequent calls will be instantaneous as the `Tracker` will already exist with tracking results ready to use and constantly updated.\n\n> This endpoint is idempotent, any subsequent calls with the same parameters won't duplicate `Tracker`. However, providing different information in any of the fields will create a new `Tracker` as it will be considered as a new shipment."

        This endpoint return the `Tracking` results of an existing `Tracker` matching with the given trackerId. As trackerId are unique, the `Trackings` array will always have only one item. 

        The `tracking` object is detailed in the [SCHEMAS](/schemas/tracking) section.

        Unlike the `/v1/trackers/track` endpoint, a **`Tracker`** **must first be created on this tracking number before using this endpoint.** As a tracking number is not unique, the endpoint may return multiple `trackings` associated with different `Trackers`.
